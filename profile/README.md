**Montreal-based technology consulting empowering digital freedom through self-hosted solutions**

## Business Overview

Casa Eureka guides individuals toward technological autonomy by implementing privacy-focused, self-hosted alternatives to commercial cloud services. Founded by Maxime Séguin (20+ years software development/architecture experience), the business prioritizes education and empowerment over dependency.

## Core Services

### Homelab Solutions
Personal server infrastructure hosting self-controlled applications. Starting $100 (Raspberry Pi) to custom enterprise-grade setups. Replaces Google Drive, Netflix, password managers, VPNs with FOSS alternatives (Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, WireGuard).

**Key Benefits:**
- $2000-3000+ annual savings (eliminated subscriptions)
- Complete data ownership and privacy
- Unlimited storage/capabilities

### Smart Home Automation
[Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) based systems providing local control without cloud dependency. Custom installations featuring monitoring (temperature, humidity, air quality), intelligent alerts (leaks, intrusions), device control (lights, thermostats, locks), and advanced automations.

**Design Principles:**

- Long-term reliability (no subscription dependencies)

### Media Server Installation
Complete entertainment infrastructure replacing streaming subscriptions. Jellyfin/Plex with automated content management (Arr stack), GPU transcoding, multi-user support, mobile access.
